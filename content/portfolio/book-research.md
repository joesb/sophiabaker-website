Planning work to conclude my final A-level project.

These last trials and experiments here use pages from my source work, *The Priory of the Orange Tree* by Samantha Shannon, and alter them using the multiple techniques explored in my research work, such as ink, watercolour, fine liner, layering, wet-on-wet techniques, and more.
